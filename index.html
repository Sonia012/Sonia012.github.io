        <h1><em>Travel to Nazaré (Portugal).</em></h1>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Miradouro_do_Suberco%2C_Nazar%C3%A9.jpg" alt="Panaramic view of the coast of Nazaré, the beach and the ocean, seen from above (Sitio)." width="600" height="200">
        <p id="general-description">Nazaré is a small fishermen's vilage on the Portuguese Silver Coast (West coast, North of Lisbon). Over the years, it has grown to be a touristic place but originally, the men went to the sea on little fishing boats, while the women would stay on land to dry the fish.</p>

            <p>Nazaré is split into 3 main areas: Nazaré center, Sitio and Pederneira.<br><br>
            <em><strong>Sitio</strong></em> is located on the headland on the right of Nazaré center (when facing the sea) and will give you a spectacular view over Nazaré. If you're in good shape, you can reach Sitio on foot, by going up the many stairs or if you're not that bold, you may take the funicular, which will take you right up to the heart of Sitio. The funicular ride is really worthwile, as it will give you a fantastic view over Nazaré and the ocean.<br><br>
            Once you're in Sitio, you can enjoy the breathtaking views, have a drink on a terrace, check out the famous <em>Church of Nossa Senhora</em> and the big square in front of it or go on to visit the fort and lighthouse (<em>Forte de São Miguel Arcanjo</em>). If you're lucky, you might get to see the world's biggest waves on the right side of the fort and see some "crazy" surfers trying to tame these waves. If you like museums, you can visit the <em>Dr. Joaquim Manso Museum</em>, which will tell you all about Nazaré's traditions.
